[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

An interactive data app built with Plotly Studio for the Plotly Analytics Vibe-a-Thon (October 2025). TuneStats allows users to explore the musical DNA of thousands of Spotify tracks, revealing the audio features that define hits, artists, and genres through intuitive and visually engaging charts.

* **Sophisticated Visualizations:** A curated collection of charts designed to tell a multi-layered story about music data, including:
    * **Genre Sonic Fingerprint (Heatmap):** Visual overview of genre characteristics.
    * **Hit Formula Explorer (Scatter Plot):** Correlates audio features with popularity.
    * **Artist Spotlight (Radar Chart):** Deep dive into an artist's unique "DNA."
    * **Futuristic Histogram:** Analyzes the distribution of any selected metric.
    * **Correlation Matrix:** Shows relationships between audio features.
    * **Tempo/Energy Density Plot:** Visualizes "hotspots" in the musical landscape.
    * **Popularity Landscapes (Ridgeline Plot):** Compares popularity distributions across genres.
    * **Audio Feature Distribution (Box Plot):** Statistically compares feature ranges across genres.
    * **And more!**
* **Responsive Design:** Built with Plotly Dash, the app is designed to work across different screen sizes.

## üöÄ How It Was Built

This application was developed entirely within **Plotly Studio** as part of the Plotly Analytics Vibe-a-Thon.

* **Data Source:** A public Spotify dataset from Kaggle, containing audio features for over 160,000 tracks (filtered down to ~28,000 tracks with merged artist/genre averages, under 75MB). Data was cleaned and prepared using Pandas in Google Colab.
* **Frontend & Backend:** Built with Plotly Dash and components generated by Plotly Studio.
* **Process:** The development involved iterative prompting, visualization curation, UI/UX refinement (including theme customization), and debugging of auto-generated components.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

## üìñ Project Story & Learnings

(You can optionally paste the "Project Story" text from your Devpost submission here for more context, or keep it concise)

This project was an exciting exploration of Plotly Studio's capabilities. Key challenges included debugging auto-generated components, managing layout updates, and ensuring consistent performance across numerous interactive charts. The process highlighted the power of generative AI for rapid app development, but also the crucial role of careful prompting, iterative refinement, and strategic problem-solving when encountering platform-specific bugs.

## üîÆ Future Ideas for TuneStats

* Integrate a predictive model for hit song potential.
* Allow users to connect their Spotify accounts for personalized analysis.
* Expand the dataset with chart performance or critical review data.
